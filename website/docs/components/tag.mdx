> A tag is an interactive label that contains text or numbers to communicate status or classification.
It may or may not be dismissible.

## Anatomy

1. **A container**
1. **A label**
1. **An icon** (optional)
1. **A dismiss button** (optional)
1. **A link** (optional)

## Usage
Use a tag to communicate status, denote active filter selection(s), or as a content tag.

- A tag may or may not be associated with another component.
When it is, it should be placed as close as possible to the component it is referencing.

:::tip Dos
- Do use a tag if this component should be dismissible or if users need to select or interact with it for any reason.
:::

:::danger Don'ts
- Don’t use a tag to communicate a temporary or permanent state if users cannot interact with or dismiss it.
Instead, use a badge.
:::

:::info Cautions
- In most contexts, a series of several tags can be overwhelming and create visual clutter.
Use tags sparingly (1–3 tags) wherever possible.
- A tag should be styled with minimal padding around the text inside the container to distinguish it from a button.
