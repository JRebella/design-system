## Summary
Usable writing helps people accomplish their goals quickly and easily.
These guidelines are for Norton employees writing instructional text, error messages, button text, and other types of interface copy for Norton digital products. 
These guidelines do not apply to author or book descriptions, catalogs, marketing materials, or other types of editorial copy.

## Principles
1. Write for all users
* Our writing is accessible and inclusive. 
We consider people’s various contexts, cognitive capacities, disabilities and needs. 
Attention and comprehension are impacted by a variety of things, including physical situation, state of mind, disability, etc. 

1. Put users’ needs first
* We help our users accomplish what they need to do quickly and easily.
We are mindful of our users’ goals and reasons for using our products. 

1. Prioritize trust and respect
* We earn our users’ trust with accurate, clear, concise writing. 
We are straightforward and transparent with our communication.

1. Less is more
* We value concision. 
We make sure our writing is accurate, clear, and brief, in that order. 
We choose to phrase things in the shortest, simplest way possible while preserving meaning and understanding. 

## Dos & Don’ts
### Do
* **Write for all users.** 
All people have a limited ability to process information called cognitive capacity.
Cognitive capacity increases or decreases for each of us depending on situation, disability, and language fluency, and is depleted more rapidly by complex, difficult, or indirect language. 
Be direct and clear to keep cognitive capacity high. 

* **Put users’ needs first.**
Help them accomplish their goals. 
Try to make people’s lives easier. 
Respect their time.

* **Be accurate, clear, and brief (in that order).** 
Concision is important, but don’t sacrifice accuracy or clarity for it.

* **Aim for just enough copy.**
Use fewer words if possible.
Understand that people scan more than they read.
Trust people to figure some things out.

* **Write how you speak.**
Use plain, direct language and say it out loud.
Aim for an 8th grade reading level. 
Be consistent and clear. 

* **Communicate hierarchy.**
Use headings to show what’s important.
Chunk longer pieces of content into meaningful units.

* **Keep your own expertise in mind.**
Ask other (non-Norton) people to read your copy.
You have insider knowledge that your users don’t.

* **Know when to violate traditional writing and grammar rules.**
Good usable writing isn’t always grammatically correct, like colloquial speech.
For usability, it’s best to default to the way most people speak even if it’s “incorrect.”

### Don’t
* **Don’t assume what your users’ needs are.**
Back up your assumptions with data or qualitative research wherever possible.

* **Don’t expect people to trust you automatically.**
We need to create that trust through accurate and understandable writing.

* **Don’t over-explain.**
This diminishes trust.

* **Don’t use jargon, internal terms, or unnecessarily big or fancy words.**
If there’s a simpler and less formal way of saying something, do it.

* **Don’t punish people or create obstacles.**
Requiring them to read too much text is an obstacle.

* **Don’t forget that you’re not the only kind of user.**
This narrows your perspective.
The goal is to broaden it.
