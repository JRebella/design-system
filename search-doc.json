Example: focus halo To see the focus halo in action, tab to the following button. Focus halo Using the focus halo for most elements ensures a few things that are key to a well-designed focus indicator: Color contrast can always be assured against both the background and the element's background.It is more visually apparent than a normal outline. Focus cannot be visually tracked from point to point like mouse movement can, so it needs to be more visually obvious than most visual elements on a page. It meets WCAG 2.2 Focus Appearance (Enhanced) under most circumstances by including the following: A focus indication area of 2px + a 1px offset.High contrast between the background color and the element's color under nearly every scenario.A high on-focus z-index to ensure that it is never obscured by other content.

Left and right margins should be the same width.Margins can be adjusted to ensure appropriate line length at each breakpoint range. Gutters and margins can be different widths.A Breakpoint Range is a range of screen sizes that have the same layout. At each breakpoint, the layout may adjust to better fit the screen size.The number of columns and the width of the margins and gutters is determined by each breakpoint range. ::: tip Dos Do align major content areas or regions of the page to the layout grid.Do design layouts for the smallest screen sizes first.Do set a maximum width for the layout grid or content areas within the grid, to avoid long line lengths. ::: Don'ts Don’t set margins so large that there isn’t enough room for content.Don’t include fixed-width sidebars in the layout grid.Don’t visually reorder columns independently from their position in the markup. ## Types ### Fluid Grid - By default, use a fluid grid so that content areas flexibly scale to fit any screen width. - Column widths are set as percentages of the overall screen width. - Margins and gutters have a fixed width at each breakpoint range. ### Fixed Grid - Use a fixed grid if it is important for the width of the content area to be static within a breakpoint range. - Gutters and column widths have a fixed width at each breakpoint range, so the content only changes at each breakpoint. - Margins scale fluidly as the overall screen width changes.
